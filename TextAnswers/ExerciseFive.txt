2) Tracking is a method by which we can categorize and recognize different objects from frame to frame. Though we can detect an object in frame 1 and frame 2, we need a time-invariant way of relating what is happening to the object as frames progress to get useful data. If there are multiple objects that are detected, tracking each of them as separate entities would prove more useful than just analyzing each frame as standalone

3) The template detection is good for finding objects in an image, but I would image it not going so well in real-time as each run takes 30 seconds or more for a single image (and video streams are many images per second!). It would be better for real-time tracking andetection by characterizing the object generically (via blurring, thresholding, etc) to process quickly per frane, allowing real (or semi-real) time to be a reality
