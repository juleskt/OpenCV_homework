2) Tracking is a method by which we can categorize and recognize different objects from frame to frame. Though we can detect an object in frame 1 and frame 2, we need a time-invariant way of relating what is happening to the object as frames progress to get useful data. If there are multiple objects that are detected, tracking each of them as separate entities would prove more useful than just analyzing each frame as standalone.
